INTRODUCTION
  & Every domino has 2 values, which we will call Attack/Defence. So a domino with both 6 and 2 values, can be used as both 6/2 and 2/6. You can watch our {{video guide|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjZb190qn00}}.
SETUP
  & Each player draws 7 random tiles.
  & To determine which player begins, both players flip a tile, the player with the highest combined value is the attacking player.
DRAW PHASE
  & The Attacking Player(AP) can forfeit their attack by exchanging a tile for a random one from the draw pile. In that case, the opponent becomes the Attacking Player.
TURN PHASE
  & The AP chooses an attacking tile from their hand, and plays it vertically toward the Defending Player(DP). From the perspective of the AP, the top value is the attack value, the bottom value, the defense value.
  & The AP chooses a defending tile from their hand, and puts it vertically toward the Defending Player.
  & A game lasts 7 rounds.
