PROLOG
  In the beginning, there are birds.
  They consume water faster than we can syntetise it.
  Little red humming-bird-like creatures carrying drought.
  They reveal to us how to build ships.
  We leave our now planet dry.

  Soon, we find an Actor.
  The whole of the Free Will Academia is trilled.
  But the actor is dead.
  It is locked deep within localized time.
  A small impenetrable hole in space.

  ~

  Our scientists complete the first module, of the last machine.
  The module computes how to build anything.
  It brings about the end of science.

  We then have the tool to explore the collapse.
  The tool tunnels through the immobile time.
  A small city, and at its center, the corpse of the Actor.
  Its head empty, the city is its thoughts and mind.
  We find more Actors, on other stars.

  ~

  Our scientists complete the second module, of the last machine.
  The module computes what has to be built.
  It brings about the end of the space age.

  The universe is complete and the whole of space organized.
  We find a heavy object, unmoving.
  A small box, no longer than twice the lenght of a hand.
  All over the box, are ports, holes, and intricate designs.

  ~

  On one side, in one corner, is a small lens.
  Nothing like our science.
  The last machine builds a telescope to look into the lens.
  Looking into the box is like looking at the stars.
  The telescope can only zoom in or out, it does not allow for lateral movement.
  The zoom acts more like a translation.
  
  At first, it reveals the whole of the universe.
  Looking deeper, our system, planet, station, room and self is visible.
  Looking deeper yet, the box, the lens and the whole of the universe is shown over again.

  The puzzle box was beautiful, yet simple.
  A deep mirror, is placed above the lens of telescope.
  Looking deeper, our system, planet, station, room, mirror, room, station, planet, system and the answer is revealed.
  The puzzle box was an invitation to the Two Mansions.

THE TWO MANSIONS
  In a most cartesian space.
  Post science and exploration civilisations gather here.

  THE LOBBY

  Averaged from the guests' habitual dimensional frameworks, the Two Mansion spread across the double cardinal dimension.
  To put it simply, a circle contains 720 degrees.
  Or where you would expect North, East, South and West when turning clockwise onto yourself.
  Were you to keep on turning, you would encounter Mur, Velt, Hul and Dalt.
  Not only does this condensed space exist around you, it also exists within pitch, above and below you.
  If only to normalize the density.

  To accomodate simplier guests, cardinals are painted on the ground.
  Other guests clearly do not need them, they seem to appear and vanish as they casually traverse this new space.

  THE VESTIBULE

THE CARBON MANUAL
  A manual explains your destination.
  It covers where to go and not go.
  Who to speak to and not speak to.
  It explains non-speak and the non-going in details.

  It contains a translator, but promise that you do not need it.
  It displays the time.
  It contains a list of the guests.

  Your entry is simple.
  Writen in a language that you can read.
  It says, "birds accelerated the completion of the Last Machine".
  Science: Completed
  Space: Completed
